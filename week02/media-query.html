            <h2>Mosiah 4:19</h2>
            <p>For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the 
                same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both 
                food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the 
                riches which we have of every kind?</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:10</h2>
            <p>And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, 
                in the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord 
                surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not 
                come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</p>
